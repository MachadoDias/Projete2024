# 🏎️ Projete 2024 — Crazy Race

Repository for the code of **Projete 2024**, a racing game using remote-controlled cars, developed in **C++** with **ESP32** microcontrollers.  
The car and circuit designs were original, with 3D-printed chassis/controllers and a handcrafted track.

> ⚠️ *This project was developed some time ago and could be optimized.*

## 🧩 Main Components

- ESP32  
- TB6612FNG motor driver  
- Servo motor  
- RGB LEDs  
- LDR sensors

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **IDE:** Arduino IDE

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into four folders, each containing a codebase.  
The **master** folders include the ESPs used on the track. These handle game logic, communication between controllers and cars, and components like the display.  
The **slave** folders include the ESPs used inside the cars, responsible for movement and reading LDR sensors.
